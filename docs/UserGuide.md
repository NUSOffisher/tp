# HireShell

HireShell is a **desktop contact management application** designed for **Job Recruiters** who prefer **speed and efficiency** 
in managing (e.g. adding, deleting, editing) a large number of applicant contacts. It combines a Command Line Interface 
(CLI) with the clarity of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you are a Job Recruiter and are comfortable typing commands fast, HireShell helps you to organise, categorise and 
filter applicant contacts quickly, with minimal use of a mouse.

Instead of clicking through multiple menus, you can perform all actions using simple, structured commands. 
This lets you manage and review applicants more efficiently once you are familiar with the command format.

**What you can expect**\
In this guide, you will find:
- A [Quick Start](#quick-start) section to get the app running
- An overview of the user interface
- Step-by-step instructions for using commands
- Examples to help you learn faster
- Troubleshooting tips

3. Create a folder (e.g. named **HireShell**).

4. Move the `hireshell.jar` file into this folder.

5. Open a command terminal and navigate to the **HireShell** folder.
   - **Windows:** Use Command Prompt or PowerShell
   - **Mac/Linux:** Use Terminal 

Example: 
```bash
cd path/to/HireShell
```

6. Run the application using the following command: 
```
java -jar hireshell.jar
```

7. If the setup is successful, the HireShell GUI (see below) should appear in a few seconds. \

8. Type the command in the command box and press `Enter` to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing `Enter` will open the help window.<br> \
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com rt/8.5 s/Fresh rs/Yes r/Software Engineer` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

9. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [r/ROLE]` can be used as `n/John Doe r/Software Engineer` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[r/ROLE]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `r/Software Engineer`, `r/Software Engineer r/AI Analyst` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, HireShell will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the HireShell to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous HireShell home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
