## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/hireshell/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/hireshell/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/hireshell/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/hireshell/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/hireshell/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as two steps in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it requires other interactions (between the command object and the list it receives) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/hireshell/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Role` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Role` object per unique role, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Role` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/hireshell/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.hireshell.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` (truncated add command) to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Use cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `HireShell` and the **Actor** is the `Recruiter`,
unless specified otherwise)

> **Note:** Simple, single-step commands (`list`, `sort`, `help`, `clear`, `exit`, `export`, `select`) are not documented as separate use cases as their interactions are straightforward. `find` follows the same pattern as UC02 — a single input with an error extension for no matches.

**Use Case: UC01 - Add a candidate**

**MSS:**
1. Recruiter enters the `add` command with the required fields (name, phone, email, status, referral status) and any optional fields (rating, role, detail).
2. HireShell validates the input.
3. HireShell adds the candidate and displays a success confirmation message.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use case ends.

**Extensions:**

* 1a. HireShell detects a missing or invalid required field.
    * 1a1. HireShell displays an error message indicating the correct command format.
    * 1a2. Recruiter re-enters the command with corrected information.
    * Steps 1a1–1a2 are repeated until all required fields are valid.
    * Use case resumes from step 3.

* 2a. HireShell detects a duplicate candidate (same name and phone number already exists).
    * 2a1. HireShell displays an error message indicating the duplicate.
    * Use case ends.


**Use Case: UC02 - Delete a candidate**

**MSS:**
1. Recruiter enters the `delete` command with a valid index.
2. HireShell deletes the candidate at that index and displays a success confirmation message.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use case ends.

**Extensions:**

* 1a. The specified index is invalid (out of range or non-positive integer).
    * 1a1. HireShell displays an error message.
    * Use case ends.


**Use Case: UC03 - Edit a candidate**

**MSS:**
1. Recruiter enters the `edit` command with a valid index and at least one field to update.
2. HireShell validates the new field values.
3. HireShell updates the candidate and displays a success confirmation message.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use case ends.

**Extensions:**

* 1a. The specified index is invalid (out of range or non-positive integer).
    * 1a1. HireShell displays an error message.
    * Use case ends.

* 1b. No fields are provided.
    * 1b1. HireShell displays an error message indicating at least one field must be specified.
    * Use case ends.

* 2a. A provided field value is invalid.
    * 2a1. HireShell displays an error message describing the invalid value.
    * Use case ends.

* 3a. The edit would result in a duplicate candidate (same name and phone number as an existing entry).
    * 3a1. HireShell displays an error message indicating the duplicate conflict.
    * Use case ends.


**Use Case: UC04 - Batch delete candidates**


**MSS:**
1. Recruiter enters the `batch delete` command with one or more filter conditions (status, role, rating, and/or date).
2. HireShell identifies all candidates in the **current list view** matching **all** the specified conditions.
3. HireShell deletes the matching candidates and displays a confirmation with the number of candidates deleted.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use case ends.

**Extensions:**

* 1a. No filter conditions are provided.
    * 1a1. HireShell displays an error message indicating at least one condition is required.
    * Use case ends.

* 1b. A filter condition has an invalid format (e.g. unrecognised operator or missing value).
    * 1b1. HireShell displays an error message describing the invalid condition.
    * Use case ends.

* 2a. No candidates match the specified conditions.
    * 2a1. HireShell displays a message indicating no candidates were found matching the criteria.
    * Use case ends.


**Use Case: UC05 - Batch edit candidates**

    * 1d1. HireShell displays an error message describing the invalid value.
    * Use case ends.

* 2a. No candidates match the specified filter conditions.
    * 2a1. HireShell displays a message indicating no candidates were found matching the criteria.
    * Use case ends.

* 3a. Applying the edits would create a duplicate candidate (same name and phone number as an existing entry).
    * 3a1. HireShell displays an error message indicating the duplicate conflict. No candidates are edited.
    * Use case ends.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  Data should be automatically saved to the local hard disk after every command that modifies data to prevent loss during a crash.
5.  Candidate phone numbers and personal data must be stored in a human-readable but localized format, ensuring no data is transmitted to external servers without consent.
6.  100% of the application’s features must be accessible via keyboard shortcuts, catering to high-speed "power users" in recruiting
7.  The system must provide immediate visual confirmation (e.g., a status message or color change) within 50ms of a command being executed to confirm the action was successful.
8.  The "Delete" function must ensure that all traces of a candidate’s phone number are purged from the local state, helping the manager remain compliant with data privacy laws like GDPR or PDPA.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Private contact details**: A contact's detail that is not meant to be shared with others
* **Candidate**: An individual whose contact details and hiring status are being tracked in the system.
* **CLI (Command Line Interface)**: The primary text-based input method used by Recruiters to interact with the application without using a mouse.
* **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**: A visual interface where Recruiters interact with the application using graphical elements like buttons, icons, and menus
* **Auto-completion**: A productivity feature where the user presses the Tab key to have the system suggest or finish a command or parameter, reducing typing effort.
* **Batch-import**: The process of pulling multiple candidate records into the system at once from an external file (like a university portal list) rather than adding them individually.
* **Duplicate Entry**: A record that matches an existing contact based on the Primary Key (the unique combination of Name + Phone Number).
* **Source**: The origin of the candidate's data (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub, or a specific University Career Portal).

   1. Test case: Manually edit `data/hireshell.json` and remove the `createdAt` field from one of the person entries.<br>
      Expected: HireShell detects the illegal value, starts with an empty address book, and logs the error.

   1. Test case: Manually edit `data/hireshell.json` and change a `createdAt` value to an invalid format (e.g., "invalid-date").<br>
      Expected: HireShell starts with an empty address book due to data loading failure.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

**Team Size: 5**

1. **Make command history persist:** The current implementation of the command history does not display the command history for the previous session (i.e. not persistent through app restarts).
   We plan to make the command history persistent across sessions, such that users can still see the command history from their previous session when they restart the app.


2. **Allow for custom exported file names:** The current implementation of the export function does not allow users to specify the name of the exported file, and defaults to `hireshell_export.csv`.
   We plan to allow users to specify the name of the exported file, such that they can choose a more descriptive name for their exported file (e.g. `candidates-april-2026.csv`).


3. **Allow for custom save file paths:** The current implementation of the save function does not allow users to specify the path of the saved file, and defaults to the current working directory.
   We plan to allow users to specify the path of the saved file, such that they can choose where they want their data to be saved (e.g. `C:/Users/John/Documents/hireshell_data.json`).


4. **Implement range filtering:** The current implementation of the filter function only supports filtering by a single value (e.g. `filter rt/> 8.0` to filter candidates with rating strictly greater than 8.0).
   We plan to implement range filtering, such that users can filter candidates with rating between 7.0 and 9.0 using `filter rt/>=7.0 rt/<=9.0`.


5. **Allow alphabetical sorting for name:** The current implementation of the sort function only supports sorting by rating.
   We plan to allow users to sort candidates alphabetically by name using `sort n/asc` or `sort n/desc`.


6. **Implement tie-breakers for sorting:** The current implementation of sorting only allows users to sort by rating. However, multiple candidates can have the same rating, in which case the order of those candidates will just be by date added.
   We plan to allow users to specify other fields, such as role or referral status. For example, `sort rt/desc rs/asc` will sort candidates by rating in descending order, and if there are ties in rating, those candidates will be sorted by referral status in ascending order (i.e. Referred candidates (Yes) will be shown before Non-referred (No) candidates).

## **Appendix: Effort **

This project started from the base AddressBook-Level3 (AB3) codebase and evolved it into a recruiter-focused product.

### Difficulty level (relative to AB3)

AB3 is centered on basic contact management. HireShell is harder because we retained AB3's architectural constraints (Logic/Model/Storage/UI separation, parser-driven command flow, and test discipline) while adding domain-specific behavior for recruitment.
The increased complexity came from introducing richer candidate semantics (status/rating/details/roles), broader command behavior (filter/sort/export/batch edit/batch delete), and more validation and parser combinations than a baseline add/edit/delete/list flow.

### Main challenges faced

1. Designing command syntax that remains CLI-friendly while supporting multiple optional fields and combinations.
2. Updating UI to fit our project specifications, including updating of logic handling to ensure behavioural consistency of Ui between operations.
3. Keeping command behavior predictable when multiple filters and batch operations are applied to filtered lists.
4. Extending model format without breaking backward compatibility expectations and test stability.
5. Preserving AB3 code quality standards (layer boundaries, clear error messages, and comprehensive tests) while shipping feature growth.

### Reuse from AB3 and impact on effort

A significant portion of effort was saved through reuse.

Key reused/adapted components include:

1. Command execution pipeline and parser architecture in classes such as `AddressBookParser` and `LogicManager`.
2. Model-management patterns in `ModelManager` and list/filter update flows.
3. JSON persistence foundations in `JsonAddressBookStorage`, `JsonUserPrefsStorage`, and `JsonAdaptedPerson`.

Our effort was concentrated on adapting and extending these components for recruitment use cases, not on rebuilding the application framework itself.

### Achievements for the effort spent

1. Included new fields appropriate to the project's goal.
2. Added higher-value commands beyond baseline AB3 interactions (e.g., batch operations, filter/sort/export flows).
3. Reworked the Ui to better fit the project's goal, including updating of logic handling to ensure consistency in UI updates
4. Added command history to provide command navigation
5. Produced documentation that supports both user onboarding and evaluator traceability.
